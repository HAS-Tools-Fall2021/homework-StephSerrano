1/3: Good job but I don't see your python script submitted here?

Also a few notes:
  - for question 1 you should use the `type` function to check the type. The object type is list and the type for the elements of the object are either floats or ints.
  - You are missing a summary at the top of what your forecast is and why
  - for question 4 I'm asking for the average flow for the first half and the second half of September over all the years.  
_____

1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they? What data types are they composed of? How long are they?

  Flow: All of the flow data together would be considered a numeric type while the individual numbers would be considered floats (because they have decimal points).

  Year/Month/Day: The year, month, and day would all be considered sequence types. A range of each of the months using their index values can be used to look at the flow data. The values of the year (1989-2021), month (1-12), and day (1-31) would all be considered integers as they are all positive, non-decimal numbers.

2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

    For the month of September, 2021: 0 times (0%).

3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

  Before 2000: 1709 (22.2%)

  During 2010: 137 (37.5%)

  After 2010: 761 (9.2%)

4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

    The daily flow begins to decrease from the first half of September to the second half. The first day of September the flow was 215 cfs while the most recent on the 11th was 96.7 cfs.
