3/3: Great job! I'm glad you got it running. We'll discuss more exactly what happened and why with our workflows tomorrow. 

1. What resources did you request on Puma? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?
  - I requested a node to run the files on. I only waited in the queue for less than 5 minutes and it took only a few minutes to actually run the job.

2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Puma?
  - The most confusing part is setting up an environment and actually getting into that environment in order to run things.

3. What questions do you still have after doing this?
  - I don't necessarily have any questions but I'm moreso just amazed at how running files on a "supercomputer" is a thing.
