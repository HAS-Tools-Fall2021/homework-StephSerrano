1. What resources did you request on Puma? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?
  - I requested a node to run the files on. I only waited in the queue for less than 5 minutes and it took only a few minutes to actually run the job.

2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Puma?
  - The most confusing part is setting up an environment and actually getting into that environment in order to run things.

3. What questions do you still have after doing this?
  - I don't necessarily have any questions but I'm moreso just amazed at how running files on a "supercomputer" is a thing.
