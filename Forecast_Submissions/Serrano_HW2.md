300 cfs is my guess for the first week. Since my guess was that it had rained near the river the previous week, the cfs rate would be higher than 200 cfs. Current weather shows minimal signs of rain and higher temperatures than before which is why I think the flow is significantly less than my previous guess. I also used the plot in the Python code for the month of September in the year 2018 to show the overall trend that was occurring at the time to help guess my answer. I chose 2018 because my guess is that the weather patterns then are closest to the patterns now where as 2019 and 2020 were relatively dry. For the second week, my guess is 230 cfs based on similar reasoning as above. Since there is no signs of incoming rain and temperatures are still relatively high, the flow will be less than my guess for the first week.

## Grade:
3/3: Great job I like your logic and your use of the python script!
